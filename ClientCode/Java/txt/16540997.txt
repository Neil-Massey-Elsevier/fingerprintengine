Single phase flow through porous media and pore structure
This is an interpretative review article which does not attempt to cover the entire literature on flow through porous media. There are texts on various aspects of the subject matter that give an exhaustive bibliography, e.g. the recent books by Bear1 and by Slattery2, the older ones by Scheidegger3, Collins4 and Carman5 and the special treatise by Happel and Brenner6. The proceedings of various symposia7-12 also form an extensive source of literature. Emphasis has been placed in this review on the literature published during the past 15 years or so. Following the author's own interests, those aspects of flow through porous media that deal with the relationship between flow and pore structure have been emphasized. Another criterion used in reviewing the published literature has been whether the treatment has any chance of being tested against experimental data in the foreseeable future. Purely theoretical analyses are not included. Many aspects of the subject, such as pore diffusion, compressible and unsteady flow, and surface diffusion, have had to be left out because of limitations of space, and non-Newtonian flow and anisotropy have been treated in a very condensed manner.
